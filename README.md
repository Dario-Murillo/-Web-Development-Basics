# Web Development Basics

This repository will be used to store several examples and exercises of multiples aspects of web development. Mainly front-end using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. This is done for fun and curiosity to learn new technologies, therefore the repository will be updated unconsistently, most of my coding so far has been done in languages like C++ and C, so once again this is just an attempt at learning new and different areas of coding.

Since web development is huge and full of different technologies with constant changes and updates I will try to learn the basics of it, and in a future I might learn some JS framework like vue or angular and I will try to learn back-end, most likely with .NET, for now I will focus on what I said before.


## Requisits

It is required the use of NodeJS.
